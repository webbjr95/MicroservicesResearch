      <p>The cloud drives today's application development and IT system management. Modern cloud applications need to be
        fast, agile, massively scalable, and reliable.</p>
      <p>Containers help applications achieve all of those requirements. But putting an application into a container
        without following a design pattern is like getting into a vehicle and hoping to find way to a new city without a
        map (or GPS-enabled phone). You may end up at your destination, but the route probably wasn't the most
        efficient.</p>
      <p>This is where a microservice architecture comes in. Microservices enable an approach to software development
        and deployment that is perfectly suited to the agility, scale, and reliability requirements of modern cloud
        applications.</p>

    </mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>As the name implies, a microservices architecture is an approach in which a large application is split up into
        a set of smaller services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other processes using
        protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, or AMQP. Each microservice implements a specific end-to-end domain or
        business capability within a certain context boundary, and each must be developed autonomously and be deployable
        independently. Finally, each microservice should own its related domain data model and domain logic, and could
        be based on different data storage technologies (SQL, NoSQL) and different programming languages.</p>
      <p>
        Some key characteristics of microservices are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Microservices are small, independent, and loosely coupled.</li>
        <li>Each microservice has a separate codebase, which can be managed by a small development team.</li>
        <li>Microservices are deployed independently. A team can update an existing microservice without rebuilding and
          redeploying the entire application.</li>
        <li>Microservices are responsible for persisting their data or external state in their respective databases.
          Unlike the monolithic architecture, microservices do not share databases.</li>
        <li>Microservices communicate with each other by using well-defined APIs. Internal implementation details of
          each service are hidden from other services.</li>
        <li>Supports polyglot programming. For example, microservices don't need to share the same technology stack,
          libraries, or frameworks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Like other development platforms, Microsoft has invested heavily to meet the requirements of an architecture
        based on microservices. Today .NET provides many resources for this purpose.</p>
      <p>Microsoftâ€™s official website has a lot of content about microservices-based architecture, including ebooks,
        tutorials, videos and challenges to help developers work with them.</p>
      <p>With .NET 6, developing apps in a microservices architecture became even easier due to the new minimal APIs
        feature that simplifies many processes that were once mandatory but are now no longer needed.</p>
